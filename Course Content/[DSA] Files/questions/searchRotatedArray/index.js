/** Search in Rotated Sorted Array **
 * 
 * Given a rotated sorted array and a target, 
 * return the index of the number in the array 
 * which equals to the target.
 * 
 * Note: Your solutions' time complexity must be faster than O(n). 
 * 
 * @example
 * search([5, 4, 1, 2, 3], 2) -> 3
 * search([7, 9, 12, 3, 4], 7) -> 0
 * search([3, 4, 2, 0], 4) -> 1
 *
